#  UrbanFlow2 - AI Logistics Optimization Platform : FRONTEND SIMULATION 

#  Working on backend intergration

UrbanFlow2 is a functional prototype of an AI-powered logistics platform, designed for the Smart India Hackathon. It transforms India's complex supply chains from a reactive cost center into a predictive, strategic advantage using a hybrid AI approach.

This platform is designed to tackle severe bottlenecks in heavy industries (like steel) by optimizing vessel scheduling, port allocation, and inland routing, resulting in massive cost savings, reduced delays, and lower emissions.
